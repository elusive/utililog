### Getting Started
To view the demo application simply clone the repository and open the `dist/index.html` file in your browser.

#### Building the Application
In order to rebuild the site after any changes are made to the src folder you will need to execute the gulp script included in the root of the repository.

##### Prerequisites
The following tools must be installed in order to execute the gulp build script:

1. Node JS v10.16.0  (this version is the newest version of Node that will work)
2. Gulp JS (help can be found at [https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start/])

To install Node visit [https://nodejs.org/download](https://nodejs.org/download/).
To install gulp, run the following command:
```
$ npm install gulp -g
```

When you're done, install the rest of the theme's dependencies:
```
$ npm install
```

From here on out, simply run `gulp` from your terminal and you're good to go!

+  `gulp` - recompiles and minifies theme assets into `dist` directory and starts local server serving the theme.

+  `gulp build` - recompiles and minifies theme assets into `dist` folder.
